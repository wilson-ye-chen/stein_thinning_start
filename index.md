### About
Stein Thinning is a tool for post-processing the output of a sampling procedure,
such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). It aims to minimise a Stein discrepancy,
selecting a subsequence of samples that best represent the distributional target.

The user provides two arrays: one containing the samples and another containing
the corresponding gradients of the log-target. Stein Thinning returns a vector
of indices, indicating which samples were selected.

In favourable circumstances, Stein Thinning is able to:

* automatically identify and remove the burn-in period from MCMC,
* perform bias-removal for biased sampling procedures,
* provide improved approximations of the distributional target,
* offer a compressed representation of sample-based output.

### Installation

Implementations of Stein Thinning are available for Python, R, and MATLAB:

* [Install for Python](https://github.com/wilson-ye-chen/stein_thinning#installing-via-git)
* [Install for R](https://github.com/wilson-ye-chen/stein.thinning#installing-via-github)
* [Install for MATLAB](https://github.com/wilson-ye-chen/stein_thinning_matlab#installation)

### Get Started

First, it is important to parametrise the distributional target so that it
has a positive and differentiable density <img alt="formula" src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=p(x)" /> on <img alt="formula" src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mathbb{R}^d" />.

In [Python](https://github.com/wilson-ye-chen/stein_thinning#getting-started),
[R](https://github.com/wilson-ye-chen/stein.thinning#getting-started),
or [MATLAB](https://github.com/wilson-ye-chen/stein_thinning_matlab#getting-started),
it takes a single function call to start Stein Thinning:
```python
indices = thin(samples, gradients, m)
```

Here
* ```samples``` is an array with <img alt="formula" src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n" /> rows and <img alt="formula" src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=d" /> columns, whose rows are the samples <img alt="formula" src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=x" /> produced by a sampling method, such as MCMC,
* ```gradients``` is an array with <img alt="formula" src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n" /> rows and <img alt="formula" src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=d" /> columns, whose rows contain the gradients <img alt="formula" src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\nabla%20\log%20p(x)" /> where <img alt="formula" src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=x" /> is the corresponding row of ```samples```,
* ```m``` is an integer, specifying the number of representative samples required,
* ```indices``` is a vector of length <img alt="formula" src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=m" />, whose elements are integers in <img alt="formula" src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\{1,\dots,n\}" />, indicating which samples were selected.

### Stan Examples

Stein Thinning can be used to post-process the output directly from the Stan family of probabilistic programming languages:
* [PyStan](https://github.com/wilson-ye-chen/stein_thinning#pystan-example)
* [RStan](https://github.com/wilson-ye-chen/stein.thinning#rstan-example)
* [MatlabStan](https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/matlab-stan)
